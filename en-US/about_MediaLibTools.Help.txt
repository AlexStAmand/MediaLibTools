SHORT DESCRIPTION	
	Sets the language metadata flag on .mp4 & .m4v video files.
	
LONG DESCRIPTION
	When a media files language is not properly set (or is 'undefined') then media servers (such as Plex) may report the language as "Unknown Audio" in the media details.

	This cmdlet will recursivly search a given path for any media files with either a missing or incorrectly set language metadata flag and correct it.

	The Powershell Module 'Get-Mediainfo' (GetMediaInfo.dll) is used to detrmine which files require modification. The cmdlet then uses mp4box.exe to set the language metadata tag on the video and/or audio tracks of each file. If the file only requires one track be modified then only that track will be processed.
